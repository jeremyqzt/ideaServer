Project Plan:
1) Get data
 * This may not be easily done in the way I want so maybe train several different models?
 * Use a brute force method to split?
    * Possible choices 
    * -> Amazon recommendation system based on reviews
    * -> Movie recommendation based on https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/recommendation-system-tensorflow-overview
    * -> Books from https://morioh.com/p/1e7fe8c39c1a
2) build model
3) Train model
4) build simple server
5) Server recommendations via an API
